# 📚 My Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! This is where I document and organize all the projects, exercises, and code I create while following various courses on Udemy (and potentially other learning platforms).

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing a **different course or a distinct project** from my learning path.


## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:
*   **Practice:** To actively code along with course material and solidify my understanding.
*   **Portfolio:** To build a collection of projects that demonstrate my growing skills.
*   **Reference:** To create a personal knowledge base I can refer back to in the future.

## 🛠 Technologies & Topics

The technologies and topics covered here will evolve over time as I take new courses. You can expect to find projects related to various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies.

## 📝 Note

This is a personal learning log. The code in this repository is primarily based on course tutorials and exercises, and is intended for educational purposes.
